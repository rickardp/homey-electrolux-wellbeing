# Electrolux Pure
Adds support for Electrolux Pure air purifiers

## Obsolete app

I no longer use the app myself, thus I will not be able to keep up with this everytime Electrolux decides to change backend API. Electrolux has been making breaking changes to their API quite frequently, whichs highlights the problems with using vendor specific cloud APIs to do home automation.

While creating apps agains vendors' cloud APIs may work in the short term, they are dependent on maintainers actively chasing these changes and updating the apps. As a recommendation, look for devices with local access like Zigbee instead of having to bounce off the cloud.

### Maintainers needed

I am happy to add maintainers or transfer ownership of the app to anyone who is up for the task, but other than that I will not maintain this app going forward. Please reach out if you are interested.
